Lazarus/Free Pascal Mirror Bitmap Unit
=====================

This unit allows for the mirroring of bitmaps, by either their horizontal or
vertical axis.  It also contains a function to allow you to mirror text by in
the same ways.  The text mirroring function takes text and returns a TBitmap
object.  The other items take a TBitmap and return a TBitmap.

The source code should be well enough commented so that someone with almost no
expirience using Free Pascal or Lazarus should be able to follow the code.
